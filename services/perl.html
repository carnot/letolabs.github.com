<h1>Custom Perl Development</h1>

<p>
Leto Labs, LLC brings over 14 years of Perl development experience to each
problem in search of a solution.
</p>

<p>
The philosophy of Leto Labs, LLC is that building reusable open source
components benefits everyone. Instead of writing 100 lines of proprietary code
that will never see the light of day, one can almost always write 80 lines of
code that is reusable and then another 20-30 lines of code that specializes that
reusable component for a specific situation.
</p>

<p>
Everyone wins when there is a vast library of reusable components to choose from.
It prevents endless wheel-reinventing.
</p>


<h1>Perl Training</h1>

<p>
Need some help grokking Perl? Does your employee need a refresher course? Is your
business completely dependent on a Perl script that no one understands how to fix?
We can help solve these problems, and many more.
